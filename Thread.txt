
Create execService for thread pool
ExecutorService execService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Integer.parseInt(THREAD_COUNT));

Threan created thread (worker thread) class by implemneting Runnable and implenment logic for run()

start for loop{
MyThread thread = new myThread(param1,param2);
public class MyThread implements Runnable  {}

execService.execute(thread);
}end for loop

execService.shutdown();

while(!execService.isTerminated()){				
	execService.awaitTermination(64000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
}


			
based on records aviable for processing create thread count
String THREAD_COUNT = "3";
if count<5000 then THREAD_COUNT =2 if count<100 then THREAD_COUNT =1

create connection pool same as thread count (create Vector calss object for thread safety and put all connection object in )


ExecutorService execService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Integer.parseInt(THREAD_COUNT));
